Building and analysis of a Data Warehouse from a dataset ([mavenanalytics.io](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/)) of New York City accidents in 2020. I worked on the whole decision-making process from the data extraction phase to the report phase, for that, I used [**Talend**](https://www.talend.com/) solutions for the ETL phase, **[MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** as DBMS, and **[POWER BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)** for reporting and data data visualization.
